# Project Title

Transfer Learning for Mapless Quadrotor Navigation Using Recurrent Neural Network

## Getting Started

There are two parts for this project
* Collecting the state-action pairs from a motion planner
* Training Reinforcement learning navigation model in OpenAI Gym environment 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

```
flkfjk
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
